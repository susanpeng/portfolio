Iâ€™ve been using GitHub for about three years and have extensive experience using command line git. Because I have ten+ years of experience using Unix and Linux shell scripts, command-line git is not a problem for me but allows me to work more efficiently.

Due to my working experience as a developer, I love the concept of docs-as-code. That is also what I like to do in my work. For example, I often go to code mode directly to edit the content instead of using the visual editor when using WordPress; using code mode is faster and more convenient. I also like to use VS Code or Atom to edit HTML/CSS or Markdown because they make writing and online publishing more efficient and allow developers to involve in the documentation creating process without learning some DITA authoring tools.

I have working experience with static site generators; my GitHub portfolio site was generated using Hugo.
