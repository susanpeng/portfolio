Bookshelf Editor User's Manual (https://susanpeng.github.io/techwriter/writings/helpmanual/index.html)

Usability Testing Report (https://susanpeng.github.io/techwriter/writings/helpmanualusa/index.html)

I created this User's Manual as a project in one of my Technical Writing courses. I received the Bookshelf Editor program without any documentation. I had to go through the whole program to figure out all functions and operational steps by clicking menu items, buttons and links on screen in the program. After obtaining a sufficient understanding of the program, I created this User's Manual. It was a great process of learning technical concepts and skills and then converting them into clear and concise content for a general audience.

To enhance the effectiveness of this User's Manual, I conducted a usability test to get feedback from the test participants. Then I further modified the User's Manual according to the test feedback. The Usability Testing Report is included in this sample.

I created this manual using Oxygen XML Editor, and the links point to the plain HTML version of the manual and the report. Using Oxygen XML Editor, the DITA content can be easily transformed into PDF, ePub and WebHelp output to meet different needs.

Although this sample is a bit old, it shows that I can plan and write a software user's manual in plain English.

The Index and Glossary also make the user's manual easy to use, especially when searching for information.

The usability test report shows that I understand the importance of making documentation usable and effective.

I have learned a lot about the entire process of creating a software user's manual from working on this writing project.

Recently, I edited the manual and report using VS code and uploaded it to the repo of GitHub. It is now hosted on GitHub.

I was the writer and editor of this user's manual. While creating the user's manual and test report, I received the instructor and classmates' suggestions.
