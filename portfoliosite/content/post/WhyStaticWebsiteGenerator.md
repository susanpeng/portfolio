Sometimes we need a website to host only static web pages; that means the content of the webpage keeps unchanged. 

Under this situation, we don't need a heavy server that gets content from the backend database server and renders the webpage to send back to the browser, which is expensive and complex.


At the same time, we would like to get the website to work fast at minimalistic decoration. We also want the site to work at a low cost and minimal coding time.

This is the situation the Static Website Generator gets in.

A static site generator can get your website running in a super short time, sometimes maybe in ten minutes. It can also minimize your maintenance work. It allows you to write your pages as markdown files and add them to the content folder.

Right now, there are many static website generators. Hugo is the one that is getting more popular.
