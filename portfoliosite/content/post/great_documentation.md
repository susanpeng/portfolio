Great documentation should include contextual content that clarifies why and when users might use a feature or workflow. It should tell the software version, the working or installation environment (windows, mac, which version of the operating system), etc. It should keep the readers on the same page at the very beginning.

Great documentation should be clear and concise and clearly divide information into conceptional, instruction, and reference parts. For the instructional documentation, it is important to organize the content task-centered, following the work procedure.

Great documentation should keep a consistent layout, font type, word usage, etc., which will make it easy to follow; because readers tend to read or use documentation in an expected way.

Great documentation should let users easily find the information they need, so I think Glossary and Index are essential for good documentation.
