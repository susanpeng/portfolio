What is your editing procedure?

As an editor, I am always asked a question like this: “What is the editing procedure?”, “How do you do your editing work?”, or "Why don't we have an editor in our technical writing team?"

Well, firstly, many people know editing, but don’t know that actually, edit work can be devided into several level. There are development editing, structural editing, stylist editing, copy write editing, and proof reading.


So when you ask about editing work, you need to clarify what kind of editing you are talking about.

My editing procedure:

First, I'll read the whole writing to understand what it's about, the meaning of each sentence.

Then I will change the writing, if the translation is not correct according to the origianl Chinese.
