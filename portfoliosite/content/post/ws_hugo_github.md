A Writing Sample: Build a Static Site with Hugo on GitHub
 
(https://susanpeng.github.io/post/hugo-how-to/)

I wrote this how-to to record the steps I used to create a static website using Hugo and got it running on GitHub.

To set up the static site, I watched several YouTube videos and checked several articles on Google.

These steps are proven correct so that I can follow them for my following static website setup. That would save me a lot of time searching for information or reading the Hugo manual from the beginning.

This How-to can also help developers who are familiar with GitHub and command lines and only need simple command lines without detailed explanations.

I didn't write the detailed steps for some common git operations.

To create this How-to:
1. I watched several videos and read some articles. I couldn't get things done by watching only one video because each video had some unclear places.
2. I wrote down steps with simple explanations while building up the website and putting it on GitHub
3. I double-checked each step to ensure the commands and their order were correct.
4. I edited the text of the How-to and rephrased the sentences to make them clear and concise.
5. I uploaded the original .md file to this site.
6. I ran: hugo -t hugo-theme-even (the theme I used).
7. I uploaded the static files to my GitHub repo susanpeng.github.io.
