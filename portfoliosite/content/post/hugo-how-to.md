I set up my first Hugo-generated website on GitHub through the process stated in this video: https://youtu.be/LIFvgrRxdt4. I write down the process step by step here for later reference because reading is much faster than watching a video.

I'm using a Mac mini m1.

First, install Hugo. If you have homebrew installed, just run:
```shell
brew install hugo
```
The Hugo will be installed on the Mac.

I used two repos for my website; one is called portfolio used to store my original files, and another is the GitHubusername.github.io repo used to store the deployed code.

Clone the portfolio repo to the local computer:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/susanpeng/portfolio.git
```
Get into the local repo's folder:
```shell
cd portfolio
```
Create a new Hugo site:
```shell
hugo new site portfoliosite
```
This command creates a site with the name portfoliosite under the folder portfolio. It also creates a folder portfoliosite under the folder portfolio. Get into the portfoliosite:
```shell
cd portfoliosite
```
You can see folders, such as archetypes, content, layouts, themes, data, and static, as well as a config.toml file.

**Pick and download a theme you like**

Put the theme under the themes folder:
```shell
cd themes
```
Go to Hugo site to pick a theme.
You can copy or clone the picked theme into the themes folder.

**Change your site's config file**

In the example folder under the picked-theme folder(portfoliosite/themes/picked-theme/exampleSite), you can see a config.toml file; copy the content of that config.toml file to your site's confit.toml file which is under your site folder (portfoliosite).
Modify your config.toml file to set:
baseURL = "https://yourgithubusername.github.io/"
title = "The name of your site"
theme="the name of your picked theme"

**Preview of the Hugo Site**
```shell
hugo server
```
This command line will start a development server on this computer on 1313 port.
Open your browser, and put "http://localhost:1313/ in the address bar. You will see your Hugo site.
To stop the Hugo server, press Ctl+c and press return.

**Write Your Content**
Create a new .md file in the post folder:
```shell
Hugo new post/my-first-post.md
```
Add some content in the .md file. You should see your Hugo site changed, and the content of my-first-post.md will appear on the site.

**Add Sub Module to Another Repo**

We want to store the static assets (deployed code) in another repo called username.github.io. 

**Note:** You have to create the repo username.github.io and push to main at least once before continuing.


Run the following command to create the submodule:
```shell
git submodule add -b main https://github.com/susanpeng/susanpeng.github.io.git public
```
"public" is the folder under the repo username.github.io and will be used to store static files generated by Hugo.
When we get into the public folder, we can see that the folder is connected to the username.github.io repo:
```shell
cd public
git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/susanpeng/susanpeng.github.io.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/susanpeng/susanpeng.github.io.git (push)
```
We can see the origin points to the username.github.io repo. That is because we are in the submodule of the username.github.io repo.
To generate static files:
```shell
hugo -t theme-name
``` 
All static files will automatically go to the local public folder.

To put the static files to GitHub:
```shell
git add .
git commit -m "put your static assets on the GitGub: repo username.github.io"
git push origin main
```
Now, you can see your new site from https://username.gitgub.io.
