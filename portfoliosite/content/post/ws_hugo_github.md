Build a Static Site with Hugo on GitHub (http://localhost:1313/post/hugo-how-to/)

I wrote this how-to for myself to review, because after the first time using the Hugo I might work on something else for a while. It is possible when I come back to work on this site I have already forgot the basic command, as the saying goes, you lose it when you don't use it. Instead watching several videos to pick up the whole process, I preffer to write it down. So later when I need to do it, I can pick up quickly. as all steps here are what I have done and proven to be right operation or at least workable.
Then I think this may also help those who are familiar with command line and just need simple guide. So I "recorded" each step.
this how to is for those who have experience with command line and git command and repo. 
To make it as short as possible. I didn't expalain the steps that is easy for those who are familiar with GitHub and its repository.

To create this how to, first I watched several videos, but each video has something that didn't work for my situation. This is also the problem with most YouTube videos. They often miss something. not like writing, you think about each line, even each word. so nomnally, text documentation is more reliable. because people create the documention are more responsible for their product. in contrast, when making videos, some times people walking without further thinking or without double checking with the vidoe content. or course, there are some YouTubers who are serious about their video and make professional look videos. but most of them don't.
Finally, the video I mentioned in the how-to provide each step clearly, I followed the instruction on the video and every step work perfectly. I set up my hugo site successfully.
Then I wrote down steps and draft explanations. I double checked each step and re ensure they are correct. lastly, I edited my writing while check for logic order of each command line to make sure everything is perfectly correct and sentences are easy to understand.
then I put the file into the content/post/ folder. 
run hugo -t hugo-theme-even, even is the theme's name I am using.
then I upload the static files to my GitHub repo susanpeng.github.io.

To make it shorter, I didn't write some very simple gitHub command line. for example, in ??? place, I just wrote, create repo ??? on GitHub without describle the detaled steps.
